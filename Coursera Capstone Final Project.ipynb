They can move because of work, family, lifestyle, culture, and many other reasons.\n\n<b><u>When moving, some people may want to live in a neighborhood similar to where they live today.</u></b>\n\nHowever, they may not know the new city they are moving to. Therefore, <b><u>we will find which neighborhoods are the best match for them</u></b>, by comparing:\n* Venues nearby of their current home\n* Venues in each neighborhood of the destination city\n\nFor this, we will consider a walking range of half mile (800m).\n\nOf course, there are many other variables that may affect this decision, such as cost of living, distance to work, criminality, etc. These will <b><u>not</u></b> be included in this analysis.\n\nTo test the models, we will run two scenarios:\n\n* <b><u>Scenario 1:</u></b> Jane currently lives in central London, and has received a job offer in Boston. She doesn't know the city, and wants to know which neighborhoods are best for her.\n* <b><u>Scenario 2:</u></b> John lives in New York, and wants to live one year abroad to improve his Spanish. He decided to go to Madrid. However, to reduce the culture shock, he wants to live in a neighborhood similar to the one he currently lives (or as similar as possible)"
